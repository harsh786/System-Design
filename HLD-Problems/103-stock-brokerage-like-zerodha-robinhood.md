# Design Stock Brokerage Like Zerodha / Robinhood - System Design Deep Dive

**Problem #103**  
**Category:** Fintech/brokerage  
**Primary pattern:** order gateway + risk + exchange adapter + portfolio  
**Deep-dive focus:** order routing, risk/margin, executions, positions, settlement

## 0. Interview Framing

A brokerage routes retail orders to exchanges while enforcing account, margin, holdings, and regulatory controls.

Actors: investors, traders, brokers, exchanges, clearing, depositories. The highest-risk path is **client order -> risk/margin -> exchange route -> execution report -> positions**. Keep the design centered there; move secondary work async unless it affects correctness, money, privacy, abuse prevention, or user-visible availability.

## 1. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Open trading/demat accounts with KYC, bank, nominee, segment activation, and agreements.
- Accept order types, modification, cancellation, AMO/GTT, portfolio, and statements.
- Run pre-trade checks on margin, holdings, exposure, price bands, and exchange rules.
- Process exchange acknowledgements, partial fills, rejects, trade files, contract notes, and settlement.
- Expose support/admin operations to inspect, replay, correct, and annotate broker_order history.
- Publish domain events for notifications, analytics, search, reconciliation, ML/risk, and support tooling.
- Support regional/cell-level degradation so unrelated markets, tenants, or products remain available.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Order and client_order_id are idempotent.
- Risk checks are fast and conservative.
- Positions/holdings reconcile with exchange/clearing/depository.
- Every mutating API is idempotent and accepts an expected version or equivalent conflict guard.
- Source of truth: Broker order plus exchange execution reports; caches, search indexes, dashboards, and read models are rebuildable projections.
- The design handles duplicate requests, duplicate callbacks, timeout, delayed events, and replay.
- PII, payment, identity, location, and regulated data are encrypted, access-controlled, audited, and retained by policy.
- The system provides operator-grade observability: traces, metrics, logs, audit trails, DLQs, and reconciliation reports.

### Non-Goals

- Do not design every UI screen; focus on backend contracts, ownership, data, and failure handling.
- Do not put analytics, notifications, emails, or search indexing on the synchronous correctness path.
- Do not keep scarce inventory, money movement, or security-sensitive decisions only in cache.
- Do not rely on distributed transactions across independently owned services; use sagas, outbox, and reconciliation.

## 2. Capacity, Traffic, And Size Estimation

Use interview-scale assumptions and state formulas so the interviewer can change the numbers.

| Dimension | Baseline Assumption |
| --- | --- |
| Users | 20M accounts, 2M peak active |
| Orders | 50M/day, bursty market open |
| Market data | Millions msg/sec |
| Execution reports | Many per partial-fill order |
| Retention | Regulatory multi-year |
| Peak QPS formula | peak = daily operations / 86,400 x burst multiplier |
| Event volume formula | events/day x average event size x replication x retention factor |
| Hot partition rule | dimension by tenant/region/entity/campaign, not only global average |

### Estimation Formulas

- Average QPS = daily operations / 86,400.
- Peak QPS = average QPS x product-specific burst multiplier.
- Storage/day = canonical writes/day x average row size x indexes x replication factor.
- Event log volume/day = events/day x average event size x retention multiplier.
- Cache memory = hot keys x average value size x replication x allocator overhead.
- External provider capacity = live requests + retries + callbacks + replay/backfill allowance.

### Sizing Notes

- Separate source-of-truth writes from read projections and analytics.
- Account for retries, callbacks, replay, and reconciliation in capacity, not only live requests.
- Keep the online broker_order aggregate compact; move large payloads, documents, telemetry, and raw reports to object storage.
- Model hot keys separately from averages; region, tenant, campaign, show, driver, account, and instrument skew can dominate.
- Separate OLTP correctness storage from OLAP/reporting storage so analytics cannot starve live mutations.

## 3. API Design

Use REST for public/partner APIs, gRPC for internal services, and async events for propagation. Every mutation includes `Idempotency-Key`, `Authorization`, `client_request_id`, and optionally `expected_version`.

| API | Important Request Fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST /v1/broker-orders | account_id, instrument, side, qty, price, product | Submit order. |
| PATCH /v1/broker-orders/{id} | new_price, new_qty | Modify. |
| DELETE /v1/broker-orders/{id} | reason | Cancel. |
| GET /v1/portfolio | account_id | Holdings/positions. |
| GET /v1/broker-orders/{id} | path id, caller identity | Read canonical state or authorized projection. |
| POST /v1/admin/broker-orders/{id}/reconcile | scope, dry_run, reason | Operator reconciliation with audit trail. |

### Internal APIs

```protobuf
service BrokerageService {
  rpc Create(CreateBrokerageRequest) returns (Brokerage);
  rpc Get(GetBrokerageRequest) returns (Brokerage);
  rpc Transition(TransitionBrokerageRequest) returns (Brokerage);
  rpc Reconcile(ReconcileBrokerageRequest) returns (ReconcileResult);
}

service PolicyService {
  rpc Evaluate(EvaluatePolicyRequest) returns (PolicyDecision);
}

service ProjectionService {
  rpc RebuildProjection(RebuildProjectionRequest) returns (RebuildProjectionResult);
}
```

### Error Model

- `400`: invalid request or unsupported transition.
- `401/403`: missing identity, policy denial, tenant mismatch, or partner authorization failure.
- `404`: resource not found or hidden by authorization.
- `409`: duplicate idempotency key with different payload, stale version, expired hold, or conflicting transition.
- `422`: business rule failure such as insufficient balance, unavailable inventory, invalid risk/KYC state, or policy denial.
- `429`: user, tenant, partner, device, IP, or endpoint quota exceeded.
- `5xx`: dependency/internal failure; return request ID and preserve retry-safe semantics.

## 4. Async Event Contracts

Use transactional outbox/inbox. Events are immutable, versioned, replayable, and partitioned by the aggregate that needs ordering.

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_01H...",
  "event_type": "brokerage.state_changed.v1",
  "occurred_at": "2026-05-25T10:15:30Z",
  "producer": "brokerage-service",
  "tenant_or_region_id": "region_123",
  "aggregate_id": "broker_order_123",
  "aggregate_version": 42,
  "idempotency_key": "idem_123",
  "actor": {"type": "user|partner|service|system", "id": "actor_123"},
  "payload_ref": "object://event-payloads/evt_01H..."
}
```

### Core Events

- brokerage.created.v1
- brokerage.validated.v1
- brokerage.state_changed.v1
- brokerage.committed.v1
- brokerage.failed.v1
- brokerage.reversed.v1
- brokerage.reconciliation_completed.v1
- brokerage.manual_review_required.v1

### Eventing Rules

- Partition by aggregate ID or natural ordering key; avoid global ordering requirements.
- Consumers are idempotent and store processed event IDs or aggregate versions.
- Sensitive payloads carry references, not raw secrets or unnecessary PII.
- Schema changes are additive first; breaking changes require a new event version.
- DLQs include owner, runbook, replay command, first failure, and last failure metadata.

## 5. High-Level Architecture

```

### Request And Data Flow

1. **Request entry:** actors enter through edge controls that authenticate, authorize, rate-limit, route, and attach trace context before reaching the Stock Brokerage Like Zerodha / Robinhood service boundary.
2. **Synchronous command path:** correctness-sensitive mutations stay inside Order gateway -> Idempotency service -> Broker order orchestrator -> State transition engine -> Portfolio service -> Risk/margin; this path performs validation, idempotency checks, source-of-truth writes, and outbox publication.
3. **Query path:** read-heavy traffic is served by Portfolio service; strong reads fall back to the canonical store when stale projections are unsafe.
4. **Async path:** Exchange adapter / Outbox/inbox workers / Admin/support console / Analytics/warehouse pipeline / Adapter manager / Reconciliation worker consume committed events for notifications, indexing, analytics, provider calls, ML/risk feedback, cleanup, and reconciliation.
5. **Operations path:** admin, audit, replay, reconciliation, backfill, and disaster-recovery workflows are isolated from user-facing latency but use the same immutable event/audit history.

### Component Responsibilities

- **Order gateway**: sessions, throttles, idempotency, validation.
- **Risk/margin**: buying power, holdings, exposure, kill switches.
- **Exchange adapter**: routes orders and normalizes messages.
- **Portfolio service**: positions, holdings, P/L, contract notes.
- **Idempotency service**: stores request hash, caller, endpoint, aggregate reference, and final response for safe retries.
- **Outbox/inbox workers**: publish committed domain events and dedupe consumed events.
- **Admin/support console**: offers timeline, replay, correction, escalation, and policy override workflows with audit.
- **Analytics/warehouse pipeline**: loads immutable events and snapshots for BI, ML, compliance, and cost reporting.

### Service Responsibility Matrix

| Layer | Services | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge/API boundary | API Gateway / WAF / Load Balancer | Authentication, authorization handoff, request validation, rate limits, routing, TLS termination, coarse abuse controls, and trace context propagation. |
| Core domain services | Order gateway, Idempotency service, Broker order orchestrator, State transition engine, Portfolio service, Risk/margin | Own Stock Brokerage Like Zerodha / Robinhood business invariants, source-of-truth writes, state transitions, idempotency, and synchronous API responses. |
| Query/serving services | Portfolio service | Serve low-latency reads from caches, read models, indexes, or specialized serving stores while exposing freshness/consistency guarantees. |
| Async workers and integrations | Exchange adapter, Outbox/inbox workers, Admin/support console, Analytics/warehouse pipeline, Adapter manager, Reconciliation worker | Consume committed events, call external systems, retry safely, update projections, run cleanup, and isolate slow dependencies from user-facing latency. |
| Data and governance | OLTP DB / cache / search index / object store / warehouse / audit log | Separate canonical state from derived stores; support rebuild, partitioning, retention, encryption, backup, and analytical access. |
| Operations | Admin console / reconciliation / observability / runbooks | Provide support investigation, replay/backfill, manual correction, compliance evidence, SLO dashboards, and incident response. |

## 6. Low-Level Design

### Core Services

- **Broker order orchestrator**: owns broker_order state machine, policy checks, outbox events, and compensation.
- **Adapter manager**: normalizes provider/partner callbacks and retries.
- **State transition engine**: validates allowed broker_order transitions using expected_version, policy decisions, and source-of-truth reads.
- **Reconciliation worker**: compares internal state, external provider reports, projections, ledger/audit rows, and emitted events.
- **Projection builder**: rebuilds search/read models from immutable events and snapshots after data loss or schema migration.

### Important Algorithms And Data Structures

- Use immutable event/audit records and rebuild projections from them.
- Use compare-and-swap transitions for contested aggregate updates.
- Use provider-specific idempotency references for every external call.
- Use transactional outbox so state changes and events commit together.
- Use optimistic concurrency for normal writes and short leases/fencing tokens for contested scarce resources.
- Use exponential backoff with jitter, DLQ, and replay tooling for external dependencies.
- Use deterministic policy/rule versions so old decisions can be explained during support or audit.

### State Machines

- Stock Brokerage Like Zerodha / Robinhood: CREATED -> VALIDATED -> PENDING -> COMMITTED -> RECONCILED.
- Failure: PENDING -> FAILED -> COMPENSATION_PENDING -> REVERSED or MANUAL_REVIEW.
- External callback: RECEIVED -> DEDUPED -> APPLIED -> ACKED.

### Consistency Model

- Strong consistency for source-of-truth transitions, scarce inventory, funds/ledger, entitlement, identity, and policy gates.
- Eventual consistency for search, feed, notification, analytics, ML features, dashboards, and cache refresh.
- Optimistic concurrency with version columns for normal writes; leases/fencing for contested resources.
- Sagas with explicit compensation for multi-service workflows; no hidden distributed transaction.

## 7. Database Modeling And DB Design

### Storage Choices

- Relational OLTP for canonical aggregates, constraints, idempotency keys, and audit metadata.
- Distributed KV/wide-column store for high-write time series, hot counters, sessions, or location/score data where needed.
- Search/geo/vector index for discovery and filtering where the source of truth is elsewhere.
- Cache for hot projections, availability summaries, quotes, rate-limit state, and read-heavy timelines.
- Object storage for evidence, payloads, statements, attachments, model artifacts, and long-retention raw files.
- Warehouse/lakehouse for analytics, reconciliation, ML training, compliance reporting, and historical replay.

### Canonical Tables

| Table | Primary Key / Important Columns | Purpose And Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trading_accounts | account_id, user_id, segments, status | Account. |
| broker_orders | order_id, client_order_id, account_id, state | Order. |
| execution_reports | exec_report_id, order_id, exchange_seq, fill_qty | Execution. |
| positions | account_id, instrument_id, qty, avg_price | Position. |
| holdings | account_id, isin, free_qty, pledged_qty | Demat projection. |
| margin_snapshots | account_id, available, used, as_of | Risk. |
| idempotency_keys | caller_id, endpoint, idempotency_key, request_hash, aggregate_id, response_ref | Prevents duplicate mutation on client/provider retry. |
| domain_events | event_id, aggregate_id, aggregate_version, event_type, payload_ref | Outbox, replay, and audit event log. |
| audit_log | audit_id, actor_id, action, aggregate_id, before_hash, after_hash, reason | Immutable user/admin/service audit trail. |

### Indexing, Partitioning, And Retention

- Partition canonical tables by tenant/region plus stable high-cardinality aggregate ID; use time buckets for append-heavy history.
- Build separate indexes for product reads and operator/support lookups so debugging does not overload hot user paths.
- Use TTL only for derived/replayable data; compliance, ledger, dispute, and audit records use explicit retention policy.
- Store large payloads, proofs, statements, files, and raw telemetry in object storage referenced from canonical rows.

### Data Integrity Rules

- Each mutating request records idempotency key, request hash, caller, endpoint, response, and aggregate ID.
- Each state transition checks expected version and allowed transition from current state.
- External callbacks are deduped by provider event/reference ID before changing domain state.
- Financial or entitlement corrections are compensating records, not destructive edits.
- Reconciliation reports must be explainable back to source rows, events, provider files, and operator actions.

## 8. Critical Flows

1. Order validates account/instrument, reserves margin/holding, persists, and routes to exchange.
2. Execution reports dedupe by exchange sequence and update order/position/margin.
3. Cancel/modify correlate with original order and exchange ack state.
4. EOD reconciliation compares orders/trades/positions/holdings.
5. Event publication: the aggregate write commits with an outbox event; publisher emits to the bus; consumers dedupe and update projections.
6. Reconciliation: scheduled worker compares source of truth with provider reports/read models/ledger and creates correction tasks for mismatches.
7. Operator correction: support action requires authorization, reason, expected version, immutable audit log, and compensating event.

## 9. Deep-Dive Focus Areas

- Pre-trade risk reserves resources to avoid oversell/leverage.
- Market data is separate from order path.
- Preserve raw exchange messages for audit.
- Source-of-truth boundary: Broker order plus exchange execution reports owns correctness; all low-latency read models are disposable projections.
- Idempotency boundary: key scope includes caller, endpoint, method, request hash, and business aggregate to prevent accidental replay with different payload.
- Consistency boundary: strong for money/inventory/security decisions; eventual for search, analytics, notifications, and dashboards.
- Replay boundary: events are versioned and payloads are immutable so projections and audit evidence can be rebuilt.

## 10. Scaling Bottlenecks And Mitigations

- Hot accounts/entities/campaigns create partition skew; use virtual shards and per-entity throttles.
- Provider timeouts create retry storms; isolate queues per provider.
- Backfills/replays must be throttled and observable.
- Hot tenants/entities can overload a shard; use virtual shards, adaptive throttles, and queue isolation.
- External dependencies can create retry storms; isolate queues per provider and apply circuit breakers plus load shedding.
- Large historical queries and exports run on analytical replicas/object-store snapshots, not primary OLTP.
- Backfills and replays are rate-limited and observable so they do not compete with live traffic.

## 11. Security, Privacy, Abuse Prevention, And Compliance

- Protect KYC, bank, demat, holdings, and trading behavior.
- Detect ATO, wash trades, spoofing, insider misuse, fat-finger, and margin abuse.
- Use least-privilege RBAC/ABAC for users, partners, services, support, and break-glass access.
- Encrypt sensitive fields, rotate secrets, sign webhooks/callbacks, and tokenize payment/bank identifiers where applicable.
- Audit policy changes, manual overrides, exports, refunds/adjustments, and privileged reads.
- Run abuse detection on velocity, device, IP, account graph, payment instrument, partner behavior, and anomalous state transitions.

## 12. Reliability, Failure Modes, And Recovery

- Keep pending/unknown as explicit state on timeout.
- Reconcile internal state against provider reports and immutable events.
- Use replay to rebuild projections after bugs or schema migrations.
- Use durable queues for asynchronous work and DLQs with owner, retry policy, replay command, and runbook.
- If a dependency times out, keep the aggregate in explicit pending/unknown state and converge through callback, status poll, or reconciliation.
- Use backups plus event replay to recover projections; test restore and replay regularly.
- Prefer graceful degradation: pause risky mutations while preserving reads, active sessions, safety flows, and support access.

## 13. Deployment And Operations

- Deploy services independently behind API gateway routing with backward-compatible API and event schema versions.
- Use canary or blue/green deployments for orchestrators, risk/pricing engines, and provider adapters.
- Run schema migrations as expand-migrate-contract and keep rollback playbooks for hot paths.
- Use per-region feature flags, kill switches, and dependency circuit breakers.
- Maintain runbooks for backlog growth, provider outage, stuck aggregate, reconciliation mismatch, and data replay.

## 14. Observability: SLIs, SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts

- SLIs: broker_order mutation success rate, read latency, transition error rate, idempotency replay rate, queue lag, and reconciliation mismatch rate.
- Dashboards by tenant, region, aggregate state, provider, dependency, app version, and release version.
- Alerts for stuck state machines, DLQ growth, provider error spikes, hot partitions, reconciliation drift, and p99 latency regressions.
- Distributed traces carry request_id, idempotency_key, aggregate_id, aggregate_version, and downstream provider reference.
- Audit dashboards expose manual overrides, policy changes, replay actions, and data export access.

## 15. Cost Model And Trade-Offs

- Provider/API fees, event/audit write amplification, search/index storage, and support workflows dominate cost.
- Cold history moves to object storage/warehouse; OLTP keeps working set compact.
- Primary cost drivers usually include write amplification from events/audit, provider/API fees, search/index storage, telemetry retention, and peak capacity.
- Move cold immutable history to object storage/warehouse and keep the OLTP working set compact.
- Cache hot read models with short TTL and explicit invalidation only where correctness is not compromised.
- Quantify trade-offs between latency, correctness, provider calls, operational support, and storage retention.

## 16. Key Trade-Offs

- Stronger correctness increases latency but prevents expensive business errors.
- Eventual read models scale but require pending/stale UX states.
- More fraud/risk checks reduce loss but increase false positives.
- Strong consistency on the core aggregate adds latency but prevents expensive business errors.
- Eventual consistency in projections improves scale but requires UX states for pending/stale data.
- Richer risk checks reduce losses but can increase false positives and support load.
- Provider abstraction simplifies product services but must not hide provider-specific edge cases needed for reconciliation.

## 17. Common Interview Follow-Ups

- How do partial fills update positions?
- What if exchange ack times out?
- How is broker order different from exchange order?
- Where exactly is broker_order source of truth stored?
- What happens when the external provider succeeds but the internal callback is delayed?
- How would you rebuild read models after a bad deployment?
- Which parts are strongly consistent and which are eventually consistent?

## 18. Final Interview Checklist

- Clarify scope, actors, success metrics, and the hottest correctness path before drawing components.
- Name the source of truth and the consistency boundary for the core aggregate.
- Show APIs, event contracts, HLD, LLD, data model, indexes, partitioning, and retention.
- Cover idempotency, state transitions, retries, reconciliation, and operator recovery.
- Discuss security, privacy, abuse, compliance, deployment, observability, and cost trade-offs.

## 19. World-Class Interview Review

### What A Strong Interview Answer Must Demonstrate

- **Correctness boundary:** Broker order plus exchange execution reports is the authority; derived caches, search indexes, dashboards, and analytics must be rebuildable.
- **Hot path clarity:** start from `client order -> risk/margin -> exchange route -> execution report -> positions` and walk the synchronous command path before discussing secondary features.
- **Service ownership:** explicitly assign responsibilities to Order gateway, Risk/margin, Exchange adapter, Portfolio service, Idempotency service, Outbox/inbox workers; avoid vague boxes that do not own data or decisions.
- **Data ownership:** ground the design in `trading_accounts, broker_orders, execution_reports, positions, holdings, margin_snapshots` and explain partitioning, indexes, retention, and replay.
- **Event model:** use `brokerage.created.v1, brokerage.validated.v1, brokerage.state_changed.v1, brokerage.committed.v1, brokerage.failed.v1, brokerage.reversed.v1` to decouple slow work while preserving idempotency and ordering per aggregate.
- **Operational maturity:** include backpressure, DLQs, reconciliation, runbooks, audit trails, and safe manual correction.

### Bar-Raiser Drill-Down Prompts

- Which service owns the final decision for `client order -> risk/margin -> exchange route -> execution report -> positions`, and what exact write makes it durable?
- What is the idempotency key scope, and what happens if the same key is retried with a different payload?
- Which read paths can be stale, and which user actions must revalidate against the source of truth?
- What breaks during a dependency outage, and how does the system converge after callbacks or reports arrive late?
- Which metric would page the on-call engineer before user-visible correctness, data safety, or money correctness is impacted?

### Common Weak Answers To Avoid

- Drawing only a generic API -> service -> database diagram without ownership boundaries.
- Skipping idempotency, retries, duplicate callbacks, and reconciliation.
- Putting all features on the synchronous path and ignoring backpressure or degradation.
- Treating cache/search/analytics as source of truth for critical decisions.
- Listing databases without explaining partition key, consistency model, retention, and recovery.

### Domain-Specific Bar Raiser Notes
- Prove money/ledger correctness before discussing dashboards.
- Name reconciliation inputs, provider references, reversal semantics, and audit controls.
- Separate authorization, commitment, settlement, and reporting states.

### 5-Minute Whiteboard Structure

- First minute: scope actors, constraints, and `client order -> risk/margin -> exchange route -> execution report -> positions`.
- Minutes 2-3: draw edge, command path, query path, async path, and data stores; name Broker order orchestrator, Adapter manager, State transition engine, Reconciliation worker, Projection builder.
- Minute 4: walk one critical flow and call out idempotency, consistency, and failure recovery.
- Minute 5: close with scale bottlenecks, security/privacy, observability, cost, and trade-offs.
